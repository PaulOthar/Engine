# Engine
An 3D Engine Made in Javascript, Using The HTML Canvas as Screen To Draw Pixels

Since My Computer Is A Little Bit Messy, Barely Working, I Will Launch It Witheout Optimization and Bugfixes.
My Apologies For Any Problem Derivated From The Current Version.

OBS: It needs a ImageData Variable to Render An Image, it can be obtained by drawing the said image on a Canvas(Virtual or not), then extracting the ImageData.
